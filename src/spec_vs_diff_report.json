  "summary": "Implemented a safe date parsing/formatting utility and updated PostCard and PostDetailPage to avoid calling Date formatting methods on invalid dates, and standardized sample post dates to millisecond epoch. However, the diff also introduces an unrelated backend schema change (adding `isDraft` plus a migration) and does not provide concrete evidence of an actual production deployment/publish step being performed.",
